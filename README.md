# Infinite Scroll Project
A simple project implementing infinite scrolling, where new content loads dynamically as the user scrolls down.

## Features
- **Infinite Scrolling:** Automatically loads more content when reaching the bottom of the page.
- **Smooth User Experience:** Optimized for seamless scrolling.
- **Efficient Data Fetching:** Uses pagination or lazy loading to fetch data.
## Technologies Used
- HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- Fetch API / Axios (for data fetching)
## Installation & Usage
1. Clone the repository:
```
git clone https://github.com/Akanksha-Bathla/infinite_scroll.git
cd infinite_scroll
```
2. Open `index.html` in a browser (for frontend-only version).
## How It Works
1. Listens for a scroll event.
2. Checks if the user is near the bottom of the page.
3. Fetches and appends more data dynamically.
